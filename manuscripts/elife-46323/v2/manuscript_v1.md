## Abstract

10.7554/eLife.46323.001 Response inhibition is essential for navigating everyday life. Its derailment is considered integral to numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, and more generally, to a wide range of behavioral and health problems. Response-inhibition efficiency furthermore correlates with treatment outcome in some of these conditions. The stop-signal task is an essential tool to determine how quickly response inhibition is implemented. Despite its apparent simplicity, there are many features (ranging from task design to data analysis) that vary across studies in ways that can easily compromise the validity of the obtained results. Our goal is to facilitate a more accurate use of the stop-signal task. To this end, we provide 12 easy-to-implement consensus recommendations and point out the problems that can arise when they are not followed. Furthermore, we provide user-friendly open-source resources intended to inform statistical-power considerations, facilitate the correct implementation of the task, and assist in proper data analysis.

## Introduction

The ability to suppress unwanted or inappropriate actions and impulses (‘response inhibition’) is a crucial component of flexible and goal-directed behavior. The stop-signal task (Lappin and Eriksen, 1966; Logan and Cowan, 1984; Vince, 1948) is an essential tool for studying response inhibition in neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychology (among several other disciplines; see Appendix 1), and is used across various human (e.g. clinical vs. non-clinical, different age groups) and non-human (primates, rodents, etc.) populations. In this task, participants typically perform a go task (e.g. press left when an arrow pointing to the left appears, and right when an arrow pointing to the right appears), but on a minority of the trials, a stop signal (e.g. a cross replacing the arrow) appears after a variable stop-signal delay (SSD), instructing participants to suppress the imminent go response (Figure 1). Unlike the latency of go responses, response-inhibition latency cannot be observed directly (as successful response inhibition results in the absence of an observable response). The stop-signal task is unique in allowing the estimation of this covert latency (stop-signal reaction time or SSRT; Box 1). Research using the task has revealed links between inhibitory-control capacities and a wide range of behavioral and impulse-control problems in everyday life, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse, eating disorders, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors (for meta-analyses, see e.g. Bartholdy et al., 2016; Lipszyc and Schachar, 2010; Smith et al., 2014).

**Figure 1.:** In this example, participants respond to the direction of green arrows (by pressing the corresponding arrow key) in the go task. On one fourth of the trials, the arrow is replaced by ‘XX’ after a variable stop-signal delay (FIX = fixation duration; SSD = stop signal delay; MAX.RT = maximum reaction time; ITI = intertrial interval).

Today, the stop-signal field is flourishing like never before (see Appendix 1). There is a risk, however, that the task falls victim to its own success, if it is used without sufficient regard for a number of important factors that jointly determine its validity. Currently, there is considerable heterogeneity in how stop-signal studies are designed and executed, how the SSRT is estimated, and how results of stop-signal studies are reported. This is highly problematic. First, what might seem like small design details can have an immense impact on the nature of the stop process and the task. The heterogeneity in designs also complicates between-study comparisons, and some combinations of design and analysis features are incompatible. Second, SSRT estimates are unreliable when inappropriate estimation methods are used or when the underlying race-model assumptions are (seriously) violated (see Box 1 for a discussion of the race model). This can lead to artefactual and plainly incorrect results. Third, the validity of SSRT can be checked only if researchers report all relevant methodological information and data.

Here, we aim to address these issues by consensus. After an extensive consultation round, the authors of the present paper agreed on 12 recommendations that should safeguard and further improve the overall quality of future stop-signal research. The recommendations are based on previous methodological studies or, where further empirical support was required, on novel simulations (which are reported in Appendices 2–3). A full overview of the stop-signal literature is beyond the scope of this study (but see e.g. Aron, 2011; Bari and Robbins, 2013; Chambers et al., 2009; Schall et al., 2017; Verbruggen and Logan, 2017, for comprehensive overviews of the clinical, neuroscience, and cognitive stop-signal domains; see also the meta-analytic reviews mentioned above).

Below, we provide a concise description of the recommendations. We briefly introduce all important concepts in the main manuscript and the boxes. Appendix 4 provides an additional systematic overview of these concepts and their common alternative terms. Moreover, this article is accompanied by novel open-source resources that can be used to execute a stop-signal task and analyze the resulting data, in an easy-to-use way that complies with our present recommendations (https://osf.io/rmqaw/). The source code of the simulations (Appendices 2–3) is also provided, and can be used in the planning stage (e.g. to determine the required sample size under varying conditions, or acceptable levels of go omissions and RT distribution skew).

## Results and discussion

The following recommendations are for stop-signal users who are primarily interested in obtaining a reliable SSRT estimate under standard situations. The stop-signal task (or one of its variants) can also be used to study various aspects of executive control (e.g. performance monitoring, strategic adjustments, or learning) and their interactions, for which the design might have to be adjusted. However, researchers should be aware that this will come with specific challenges (e.g. Bissett and Logan, 2014; Nelson et al., 2010; Verbruggen et al., 2013; Verbruggen and Logan, 2015).

## How to design stop-signal experiments

## Recommendation 1: Use an appropriate go task

Standard two-choice reaction time tasks (e.g. in which participants have to discriminate between left and right arrows) are recommended for most purposes and populations. When very simple go tasks are used, the go stimulus and the stop signal will closely overlap in time (because the SSD has to be very short to still allow for the possibility to inhibit a response), leading to violations of the race model as stop-signal presentation might interfere with encoding of the go stimulus. Substantially increasing the difficulty of the go task (e.g. by making the discrimination much harder) might also influence the stop process (e.g. the underlying latency distribution or the probability that the stop process is triggered). Thus, very simple and very difficult go tasks should be avoided unless the researcher has theoretical or methodological reasons for using them (for example, simple detection tasks have been used in animal studies. To avoid responses before the go stimulus is presented or close overlap between the presentation of go stimulus and stop signal, the intertrial interval can be drawn from a random exponential distribution. This will make the occurrence of the go stimulus unpredictable, discouraging anticipatory responses). While two-choice tasks are the most common, we note that the ‘anticipatory response’ variant of the stop-signal task (in which participants have to press a key when a moving indicator reaches a stationary target) also holds promise (e.g. Leunissen et al., 2017).

## Recommendation 2: Use a salient stop signal

SSRT is the overall latency of a chain of processes involved in stopping a response, including the detection of the stop signal. Unless researchers are specifically interested in such perceptual or attentional processes, salient, easily detectable stop signals should be used (when auditory stop signals are used, these should not be too loud either, as very loud (i.e. >80 dB) auditory stimuli may produce a startle reflex). Salient stop signals will reduce the relative contribution of perceptual (afferent) processes to the SSRT, and the probability that within- or between-group differences can be attributed to them. Salient stop signals might also reduce the probability of a ‘trigger failures’ on stop trials (see Box 2).

## Recommendation 3: Present stop signals on a minority of trials

When participants strategically wait for a stop signal to occur, the nature of the stop-signal process and task change (complicating the comparison between conditions or groups; e.g. SSRT group differences might be caused by differential slowing or strategic adjustments). Importantly, SSRT estimates will also become less reliable when participants wait for the stop signal to occur (Verbruggen et al., 2013, see also Figure 2 and Appendix 2). Such waiting strategies can be discouraged by reducing the overall probability of a stop signal. For standard stop-signal studies, 25% stop signals is recommended. When researchers prefer a higher percentage of stop signals, additional measures to minimize slowing are required (see Recommendation 5).

## Recommendation 4: Use the tracking procedure to obtain a broad range of stop-signal delays

If participants can predict when a stop signal will occur within a trial, they might also wait for it. Therefore, a broad range of SSDs is required. The stop-signal delay can be continuously adjusted via a standard adaptive tracking procedure: SSD increases after each successful stop, and decreases after each unsuccessful stop; this converges on a probability of responding [p(respond|signal)] ≈ 0.50. Many studies adjust SSD in steps of 50 ms (which corresponds to three screen ‘refreshes’ for 60 Hz monitors). When step size is too small (for example 16 ms) the tracking may not converge in short experiments, whereas it may not be sensitive enough if step size is too large. Importantly, SSD should decrease after all responses on unsuccessful stop trials; this includes premature responses on unsuccessful stop trials (i.e. responses executed before the stop signal was presented) and choice errors on unsuccessful stop trials (e.g. when a left go response would have been executed on the stop trial depicted in Figure 1, even though the arrow was pointing to the right).

An adaptive tracking procedure typically results in a sufficiently varied set of SSD values. An additional advantage of the tracking procedure is that fewer stop trials are required to obtain a reliable SSRT estimate (Band et al., 2003). Thus, the tracking procedure is recommended for standard applications.

## Recommendation 5: Instruct participants not to wait and include block-based feedback

In human studies, task instructions should also be used to discourage waiting. At the very least, participants should be told that ‘[they] should respond as quickly as possible to the go stimulus and not wait for the stop signal to occur’ (or something along these lines). To adults, the tracking procedure (if used) can also be explained to further discourage a waiting strategy (i.e. inform participants that the probability of an unsuccessful stop trial will approximate 0.50, and that SSD will increase if they gradually slow their responses).

Inclusion of a practice block in which adherence to instructions is carefully monitored is recommended. In certain populations, such as young children, it might furthermore be advisable to start with a practice block without stop signals to emphasize the importance of the go component of the task.

Between blocks, participants should also be reminded about the instructions. Ideally, this is combined with block-based feedback, informing participants about their mean RT on go trials, number of go omissions (with a reminder that this should be 0), and p(respond|signal) (with a reminder that this should be close to .50). The feedback could even include an explicit measure of response slowing.

## Recommendation 6: Include sufficient trials

The number of stop trials varies widely between studies. Our novel simulation results (see Figure 2 and Appendix 2) indicate that reliable and unbiased SSRT group-level estimates can be obtained with 50 stop trials (with 25% stop signals in an experiment, this amounts to 200 trials in total. Usually, this corresponds to an experiment of 7–10 min including breaks), but only under ‘optimal’ or very specific circumstances (e.g. when the probability of go omissions is low and the go-RT distribution is not strongly skewed). Lower trial numbers (here we tested 25 stop trials) rarely produced reliable SSRT estimates (and the number of excluded subjects was much higher; see Figure 2). Thus, as a general rule of thumb, we recommend to have at least 50 stop trials for standard group-level comparisons. However, it should again be stressed that this may not suffice to obtain reliable individual estimates (which are required for e.g. individual-differences research or diagnostic purposes).

Thus, our simulations reported in Appendix 2 suggest that reliability increases with number of trials. However, in some clinical populations, adding trials may not always be possible (e.g. when patients cannot concentrate for a sufficiently long period of time), and might even be counterproductive (as strong fluctuations over time can induce extra noise). Our simulations reported in Appendix 3 show that for standard group-level comparisons, researchers can compensate for lower trial numbers by increasing sample size. Above all, we strongly encourage researchers to make informed decisions about number of trials and participants, aiming for sufficiently powered studies. The accompanying open-source simulation code can be used for this purpose.

## When and how to estimate SSRT

## Recommendation 7: Do not estimate the SSRT when the assumptions of the race model are violated

SSRTs can be estimated based on the independent race model, which assumes an independent race between a go and a stop runner (Box 1). When this independence assumption is (seriously) violated, SSRT estimates become unreliable (Band et al., 2003). Therefore, the assumption should be checked. This can be done by comparing the mean RT on unsuccessful stop trials with the mean RT on go trials. Note that this comparison should include all trials with a response (including choice errors and premature responses), and it should be done for each participant and condition separately. SSRT should not be estimated when RT on unsuccessful stop trials is numerically longer than RT on go trials (see also, Appendix 2—table 1). More formal and in-depth tests of the race model can be performed (e.g. examining probability of responding and RT on unsuccessful stop trials as a function of delay); however, a large number of stop trials is required for such tests to be meaningful and reliable.

## Recommendation 8: If using a non-parametric approach, estimate SSRT using the integration method (with replacement of go omissions)

Different SSRT estimation methods have been proposed (see Materials and methods). When the tracking procedure is used, the ‘mean estimation’ method is still the most popular (presumably because it is very easy to use). However, the mean method is strongly influenced by the right tail (skew) of the go RT distribution (see Appendix 2 for examples), as well as by go omissions (i.e. go trials on which no response is executed). The simulations reported in Appendix 2 and summarized in Figure 2 indicate that the integration method (which replaces go omissions with the maximum RT in order to compensate for the lacking response) is generally less biased and more reliable than the mean method when combined with the tracking procedure. Unlike the mean method, the integration method also does not assume that p(respond|signal) is exactly 0.50 (an assumption that is often not met in empirical data). Therefore, we recommend the use of the integration method (with replacement of go omissions) when non-parametric estimation methods are used. We provide software and the source code for this estimation method (and all other recommended measures; Recommendation 12).

Please note that some parametric SSRT estimation methods are less biased than even the best non-parametric methods and avoid other problems that can beset them (see Box 2); however, they can be harder for less technically adept researchers to use, and they may require more trials (see Matzke et al., 2018, for a discussion).

## Recommendation 9: Refrain from estimating SSRT when the probability of responding on stop trials deviates substantially from 0.50 or when the probability of omissions on go trials is high

Even though the preferred integration method (with replacement of go omissions) is less influenced by deviations in p(respond|signal) and go omissions than other methods, it is not completely immune to them either (Figure 2 and Appendix 2). Previous work suggests that SSRT estimates are most reliable (Band et al., 2003) when probability of responding on a stop trial is relatively close to 0.50. Therefore, we recommend that researchers refrain from estimating individual SSRTs when p(respond|signal) is lower than 0.25 or higher than 0.75 (Congdon et al., 2012). Reliability of the estimates is also influenced by go performance. As the probability of a go omission increases, SSRT estimates also become less reliable. Figure 2 and the resources described in Appendix 3 can be used to determine an acceptable level of go omissions at a study level. Importantly, researchers should decide on these cut-offs or exclusion criteria before data collection has started.

## How to report stop-signal experiments

## Recommendation 10: Report the methods in enough detail

To allow proper evaluation and replication of the study findings, and to facilitate follow-up studies, researchers should carefully describe the stimuli, materials, and procedures used in the study, and provide a detailed overview of the performed analyses (including a precise description of how SSRT was estimated). This information can be presented in Supplementary Materials in case of journal restrictions. Box 3 provides a check-list that can be used by authors and reviewers. We also encourage researchers to share their software and materials (e.g. the actual stimuli).

## Recommendation 11: Report possible exclusions in enough detail

As outlined above, researchers should refrain from estimating SSRT when the independence assumptions are seriously violated or when sub-optimal task performance might otherwise compromise the reliability of the estimates. The number of participants for whom SSRT was not estimated should be clearly mentioned. Ideally, dependent variables which are directly observed (see Recommendation 12) are separately reported for the participants that are not included in the SSRT analyses. Researchers should also clearly mention any other exclusion criteria (e.g. outliers based on distributional analyses, acceptable levels of go omissions, etc.), and whether those were set a-priori (analytic plans can be preregistered on a public repository, such as the Open Science Framework; Nosek et al., 2018).

## Recommendation 12: Report all relevant behavioral data

Researchers should report all relevant descriptive statistics that are required to evaluate the findings of their stop-signal study (see Box 3 for a check-list). These should be reported for each group or condition separately. As noted above (Recommendation 7), additional checks of the independent race model can be reported when the number of stop trials is sufficiently high. Finally, we encourage researchers to share their anonymized raw (single-trial) data when possible (in accordance with the FAIR data guidelines; Wilkinson et al., 2016).

## Conclusion

Response inhibition and impulse control are central topics in various fields of research, including neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, neurology, pharmacology, and behavioral sciences, and the stop-signal task has become an essential tool in their study. If properly used, the task can reveal unique information about the underlying neuro-cognitive control mechanisms. By providing clear recommendations, and open-source resources, this paper aims to further increase the quality of research in the response-inhibition and impulse-control domain and to significantly accelerate its progress across the various important domains in which it is routinely applied.

## Materials and methods

The independent race model (Box 1) provides two common ‘non-parametric’ methods for estimating SSRT: the integration method and the mean method. Both methods have been used in slightly different flavors in combination with the SSD tracking procedure (see Recommendation 4). Here, we discuss the two most typical estimation variants, which we further scrutinized in our simulations (Appendix 2). We refer the reader to Appendices 2 and 3 for a detailed description of the simulations.

## Integration method (with replacement of go omissions)

In the integration method, the point at which the stop process finishes (Box 1) is estimated by ‘integrating’ the RT distribution and finding the point at which the integral equals p(respond|signal). The finishing time of the stop process corresponds to the nth RT, with n = the number of RTs in the RT distribution of go trials multiplied by p(respond|signal). When combined with the tracking procedure, overall p(respond|signal) is used. For example, when there are 200 go trials, and overall p(respond|signal) is 0.45, then the nth RT is the 90th fastest go RT. SSRT can then be estimated by subtracting mean SSD from the nth RT. To determine the nth RT, all go trials with a response are included (including go trials with a choice error and go trials with a premature response). Importantly, go omissions (i.e. go trials on which the participant did not respond before the response deadline) are assigned the maximum RT in order to compensate for the lacking response. Premature responses on unsuccessful stop trials (i.e. responses executed before the stop signal is presented) should also be included when calculating p(respond|signal) and mean SSD (as noted in Recommendation 4, SSD should also be adjusted after such trials). This version of the integration method produces the most reliable and least biased non-parametric SSRT estimates (Appendix 2).

## The mean method

The mean method uses the mean of the inhibition function (which describes the relationship between p(respond|signal) and SSD). Ideally, this mean corresponds to the average SSD obtained with the tracking procedure when p(respond|signal) = 0.50 (and often this is taken as a given despite some variation). In other words, the mean method assumes that the mean RT equals SSRT + mean SSD, so SSRT can be estimated easily by subtracting mean SSD from mean RT on go trials when the tracking procedure is used. The ease of use has made this the most popular estimation method. However, our simulations show that this simple version of the mean method is biased and generally less reliable than the integration method with replacement of go omissions.
