## Abstract

10.7554/eLife.13663.001 When innate immune cells such as macrophages are challenged with environmental stresses or infection by pathogens, they trigger the rapid assembly of multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes that are responsible for initiating pro-inflammatory responses and a form of cell death termed pyroptosis. We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop of NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS production and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium , which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.

## Introduction

Inflammation is an immunological process required for an organized response to infection, injury, and stress. Because excessive inflammation can be damaging, its initiation is highly regulated. Innate immune cells such as macrophages have evolved sensors of pathogens and homeostatic perturbations which, when activated, induce an immune response (Medzhitov, 2008). Amongst these sensors are Nod-like receptors (NLRs), which are activated in response to a diverse set of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Activated NLR proteins recruit and facilitate activation of the protease caspase-1 either directly, through caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) interactions, or indirectly, through the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC; also known as Pycard). The resulting macromolecular complex is referred to as the inflammasome (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014). The inactive precursor of the cytokine interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) is also recruited to the inflammasome complex, where proteolysis by caspase-1 induces activation and secretion of the bioactive cytokine, further promoting inflammation. In addition to cytokine maturation, inflammasome formation and caspase activation are associated with a pro-inflammatory form of cell death termed pyroptosis (Fink and Cookson, 2006). This form of cell death results in lytic release of cytosolic contents and other pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin-1α and high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), which are potent inducers of inflammation (Medzhitov, 2008; Croker et al., 2014).

Diverse activation signals have been reported as triggers of NLR signaling. For example, the NLR AIM2 is activated by cytosolic double-stranded DNA (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014; Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 2009; Hornung et al., 2009; Bürckstümmer et al., 2009), a structural feature associated with infections with pathogens and not found in healthy host cells (Fink and Cookson, 2006; Hornung et al., 2009; Jones et al., 2010). The NLR NLRP3 is a sensor of a wide variety of PAMPs and DAMPs but the unifying mechanism of its disparate activators is not understood (Sutterwala et al., 2014). Furthermore, while the NLRP3 signaling pathway can be activated by a variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, the mechanism by which these pathogens induce inflammasome signaling through this receptor is often unclear (Storek and Monack, 2015). Specifically, effective defense against Salmonella typhimurium (S. typhimurium) requires NLRP3 (Broz et al., 2010), yet the mechanism by which the pathogen activates this pathway remains unknown.

Here, we report a small molecule, GB111-NH2, that induces NLRP3 inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptotic cell death in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). Using chemical proteomics, we identify the glycolytic enzymes GAPDH and α-enolase as the phenotypically relevant targets of this molecule. Facilitating TCA metabolism downstream of glycolysis by addition of pyruvate or succinate blocked the effects of the compound. We find that S. typhimurium infection, like direct chemical inhibition of the glycolytic enzymes, reduced glycolytic flux and that restoring metabolism downstream of glycolysis also prevented S. typhimurium-induced inflammasome formation, IL-1β secretion, and pyroptosis. We find that glycolytic disruption induced by either the small molecules or S. typhimurium infection impaired NADH production, resulting in the formation of mitochondrial ROS that were essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation.

**Figure 1—figure supplement 2.:** 2 does not impair secretion of TNF-α and dose-dependently reduces IL-6 secretion.LPS-primed BMDM were treated with the indicated concentrations of GB111-NH2 for 2 hr and then analyzed for IL-6 (left) and TNF-α (right) production by ELISA.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13663.005

By fluorescence microscopy, we observed formation of foci containing the inflammasome adaptor ASC and active caspase-1 in GB111-NH2-treated BMDMs (Figure 1D). Formation of these foci was dependent on NLRP3 and ASC but not caspase-1, caspase-11, NLRC4, or AIM2 (Figure 1E–F). We observed that GB111-NH2 induced a similar level of IL-1β secretion as the NLRP3 stimuli ATP and nigericin (Figure 1G) and that the absence of NLRP3 completely abrogated IL-1β secretion induced by GB111-NH2 treatment. The absence of other NLRs, specifically NLRC4 and AIM2, had no effect on IL-1β secretion (Figure 1H). Taken together, these data indicate that GB111-NH2 induces caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion solely through the NLRP3 inflammasome, acting as an activating ‘Signal II’ for the canonical NLRP3 pathway (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014).

In order for ‘Signal II’ to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, BMDM must first be primed by a ‘Signal I’ such as LPS. LPS priming induces NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory genes such as IL-1β and inflammasome-independent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014). We measured lysate protein levels by Western blotting and supernatant cytokine levels by ELISA in BMDM treated as in previously described experiments; first primed for 3 hr with LPS and then treated for 2 hr with GB111-NH2. We observed the appearance of pro-IL-1β upon LPS priming (Figure 1I) but there was no effect of GB111-NH2 on either IL-1β protein levels in BMDM that had received LPS priming (Figure 1C, Figure 1G). In addition, IL-6 secretion decreased with increasing dose of GB111-NH2 and TNF-α secretion was unaffected by GB111-NH2 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Therefore, GB111-NH2 does not have a direct effect on Signal I, but functions predominantly as a Signal II for the NLRP3 inflammasome.

Macrophages containing active inflammasome complexes often rapidly die by a pro-inflammatory process called pyroptosis (Fink and Cookson, 2006). We observed features of this form of cell death in GB111-NH2-treated BMDM, including release of the intracellular enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (Figure 1J), and foci of caspase-1 activity in propidium iodide (PI) and Annexin V (AnnV) positive cells (Figure 1K). These data confirm that GB111-NH2 is a small molecule activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome that also triggers pyroptotic cell death.

Whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by fluorescence scan and western blotting. Gray arrowheads indicate active caspase-1 species. HSP90 serves as loading control.

Lysates were reacted with TAMRA-alkyne under Click reaction conditions, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorescence gel scan.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13663.007

We conducted a proteomic study in which we pre-treated BMDMs with either active or inactive analogs of GB111-NH2, labeled with the az-GB probe, reacted the resulting lysates with alkyne-biotin and identified affinity isolated targets using multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) (Weerapana et al., 2007) (Figure 2B). By using active and inactive compounds in our pretreatment (GB111-NH2 and GB-IA, respectively), we could identify labeled proteins that were lost by pretreatment with the active compound but not the inactive control. Employing this strategy, we obtained a short list of potentially relevant binding partners (Supplementary files 1–3). Interestingly, this list included proteins critical to cellular metabolism and homeostatic maintenance.

## Inhibition of glycolytic enzymes activates the NLRP3 inflammasome and induces pyroptosis

The GAPDH and α-enolase inhibitors KA and EB failed to induce inflammasome formation in cells that lack Pycard or Nlrp3 (Figure 3D), induced IL-1β secretion in a dose-dependent manner that was also NLRP3-dependent (Figure 3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 2), and had no effect on pro-IL-1β or NLRP3 levels in LPS-primed BMDM (Figure 3A, Figure 3F). These data demonstrate that structurally dissimilar inhibitors of either GAPDH or α-enolase activate the canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathway similarly to GB111-NH2.

**Figure 4—figure supplement 1.:** Recombinant human GAPDH or α-enolase (rhGAPDH, rhEno1) were pretreated with vehicle (veh), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 5 μM), active (GB111-NH2, 10 μM) or inactive (GB-IA, 50 μM) analogs, KA (5 μM) or EB (20 μM) for 30 min in PBS with 1% NP-40 and 0.1% SDS and then labeled with az-GB (50 μM). Reaction mixtures were reacted with TAMRA-alkyne, separated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorescence scan and Coomassie Blue to assess loading.

az-GB probe binding to both enzymes was blocked by the cysteine-alkylating compound N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and by KA and EB (for GAPDH and α-enolase, respectively), suggesting that binding was dependent on enzyme activity and was mediated by reaction with key reactive cysteines (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). To further investigate the proposed covalent interaction of GB111-NH2 with reactive cysteine residues in GAPDH and α-enolase, we performed competition studies with the general cysteine reative probe iodoacetamide fluorescein (IAF). IAF labeled both GAPDH and α-enolase, consistent with previous reactive cysteine profiling data demonstrating that the catalytic Cys 152 of GAPDH is highly reactive and Cys 388, an active-site proximal cysteine of α-enolase, is also reactive (Weerapana et al., 2010). NEM potently blocked IAF labeling, confirming that IAF was reacting with cysteine residues in GAPDH and α-enolase. Importantly, GB111-NH2 also competed for IAF labeling, indicating that it covalently binds these same reactive cysteines (Figure 4C–D).

Modification of the active-site cysteine of GAPDH and the active site-proximal Cys 388 of α-enolase have both been shown to potently impair enzyme activity (Kato et al., 1992; Ishii and Uchida, 2004). To confirm that binding of our compounds to these enzymes also inhibits enzyme activity, we performed substrate assays with recombinant GAPDH and α-enolase and found that GB111-NH2 dose-dependently inhibited turnover of the respective substrates, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and 2-phosphoglycerate (Figure 4E). GB-IA did not significantly inhibit GAPDH but did exhibit modest inhibitory activity towards α-enolase. GB111-NH2 also showed time-dependent inhibition of GAPDH and α-enolase activity (Figure 4F), suggesting that it is acting as an irreversible inhibitor (Singh et al., 2011). Taken together, these data indicate that GB111-NH2 binds covalently to reactive cysteine residues in both GAPDH and α-enolase and that binding to these cysteine residues inhibits enzyme activity.

Because GAPDH activity was recently shown to determine flux through aerobic glycolysis (

In addition to preventing inflammasome formation, supplementation of the glycolytic product pyruvate resulted in significant reductions in caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and cell death induced by GB111-NH2. Pyruvate supplementation had no effect on inflammasome signaling induced by the NLRP3 activators ATP and nigericin (Figure 6C–E), indicating that pyruvate does not impair NLRP3 inflammasome signaling by a nonspecific mechanism. Pyruvate treatment also blocked inflammasome formation induced by KA and EB (Figure 6F) and restored NADH and ATP production in the treated cells (Figure 6G–H).

## NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by GB111-NH2 is mediated by NAD+/NADH imbalance and mitochondrial ROS

We hypothesized that changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio or a drop in ATP concentration could serve as a secondary signal that connects glycolytic disruption to NLRP3 inflammasome formation. To test whether either of these signals is important, we manipulated the NAD+/NADH and ATP levels downstream of glycolysis by chemically blocking specific components of the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. We first treated LPS-primed BMDM with GB111-NH

Mitochondrial ROS and K+ efflux are proposed to be unifying signals preceding NLRP3 inflammasome formation (Tschopp and Schroder, 2010; Muñoz-Planillo et al., 2013). Therefore, we wanted to determine whether either of these signals is relevant to NLRP3 inflammasome activation induced by disruption of glycolysis. We stained BMDM with MitoSOX, a dye that reports accumulation of mitochondrial ROS, and observed that GB111-NH2 induced an increase in cellular MitoSOX fluorescence that was abrogated by addition of pyruvate (Figure 7G). We also found that the ROS scavenger 4-hydroxyTEMPO (4-HT) prevented GB111-NH2-induced caspase-1 cleavage and activation (Figure 7H). Addition of extracellular K+, in contrast, did not reduce the number of inflammasome foci in GB111-NH2-treated BMDMs (Figure 7I) or impair GB111-NH2-induced cell death (Figure 7—figure supplement 2), indicating that mitochondrial ROS, but not K+ efflux, is required for GB111-NH2-induced NLRP3 activation and pyroptosis.

We and others have shown that the intracellular pathogen

We measured glycolytic flux in infected BMDM to assess the effect of limited glucose availability on the host macrophages. Importantly, as observed for GB111-NH2 treatment, we observed reduced production of NADH and lactate (Figure 8F–H) that correlated with the multiplicity of infection and magnitude of inflammasome formation in host cells (Figure 8A, Figure 8F–H). These metabolic defects appeared on a similar timescale as initiation of NLRP3 inflammasome formation, suggesting that infection with S. typhimurium has a direct effect on glycolytic flux in host cells.

Consistent with our findings using glycolytic inhibitors, we also observed that supplementation of cells with the glycolytic end product pyruvate significantly reduced inflammasome formation, IL-1β secretion, and cell death induced by

We did not observe inflammasome focus formation in Nlrp3 -/- BMDMs upon infection with stationary phase S. typhimurium. In contrast, Nlrc4 -/- BMDMs had a similar number of inflammasome foci upon infection as wildtype macrophages (Figure 9E). Pyruvate did not prevent inflammasome formation or cell death induced by infection with S. typhimurium in log phase growth (Figure 9—figure supplement 2), an infection model that activates the NLRC4 inflammasome. We also verified that pyruvate was not blocking inflammasome formation by inhibition of bacterial replication using both an intracellular replication reporter plasmid (Helaine et al., 2010) and by monitoring bacterial replication by microscopy (Figure 9F–G). Reporter plasmid expression over the course of the intracellular replication assay indicates that intracellular S. typhimurium are viable in BMDM cultured in DMEM with or without pyruvate (Helaine et al., 2010). In vitro replication assays demonstrated that S. typhimurium grew at a similar rate in minimal media with glucose or pyruvate as a carbon source (Figure 9H), further indicating that pyruvate supplementation affects host cell recognition of intracellular bacteria rather than bacterial dynamics. Importantly, we found that the NAD+ consumption rate increased upon pyruvate treatment (Figure 9I), indicating induction of productive metabolism downstream of glycolysis in infected BMDMs. Taken together, these data indicate that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death.

## Discussion

The inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that forms in response to various pathogen- and danger-associated signals. Formation of the inflammasome leads to processing and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines to activate the immune system (Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014; Biswas and Mantovani, 2012). While inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death are critical for fighting infection and also contribute to inflammation in diseases including type II diabetes, obesity, and atherosclerosis (Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011; 2012), the signals that trigger caspase-1 activation remain poorly understood. In this study, we used a small molecule, GB111-NH2, to identify two glycolytic enzymes that regulate inflammasome formation. When functionally blocked, innate immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as a danger signal, resulting in inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Our results using this molecule and other established inhibitors of these enzymes suggest that disrupting glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages. Disturbance of glycolytic flux by the intracellular pathogen S. typhimurium similarly results in inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death in an effort to clear the pathogen. Restoration of metabolism downstream of glycolytic disruption by GB111-NH2 or S. typhimurium infection was sufficient to abrogate the inflammasome response by restoring NADH production and preventing mitochondrial ROS production.

Though the enzymes and metabolites involved in glycolysis are well established, the specific mechanisms that limit glycolytic flux are not well understood. The irreversible reactions within glycolysis, catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase, were historically thought to be rate limiting. However, recent metabolite flux analyses have also suggested that flux through GAPDH, the enzyme separating upper and lower glycolysis, is rate-limiting under nutrient-rich conditions (

![Figure 10.](https://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/13663/elife-13663-fig10-v2.jpg)

**Figure 10.:** S. typhimurium and chemical inhibitors disrupt glycolytic flux in LPS-primed BMDM, resulting in an increase in NAD+/NADH, a decrease in ATP production, and a decrease in lactate secretion. TCA cycle metabolism is also impaired, potentiating the elevated NAD+/NADH ratio into the mitochondria. Mitochondrial ROS are produced by glycolytic disruption and trigger NLRP3 inflammasome formation, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13663.024

During infection with S. typhimurium, inflammasome activation is an especially important mechanism of host response because, though it kills the host cell, it initiates inflammatory signals that activate the immune system and combat infection (Storek and Monack, 2015). Two inflammasome complexes, NLRP3 and NLRC4, are required to fully combat infection (Broz et al., 2010). The NLRC4 inflammasome responds to a clear pathogen-associated molecular pattern presented by S. typhimurium—cytosolic flagellin and type 3 secretion system components (Zhao et al., 2011). Here, we provide evidence that NLRP3 activation results in response to another effect of S. typhimurium colonization of the host cell, namely disruption of host cell glycolytic metabolism. This could explain a recent study showing that mutants of S. typhimurium defective for the TCA cycle enzyme aconitase induce a more rapid NLRP3-dependent immune response in vivo (Wynosky-Dolfi et al., 2014). We reason that aconitase deficiency would force S. typhimurium to rely even more heavily on glycolysis to survive within the host. These S. typhimurium mutants would likely disrupt cellular glycolysis more quickly and thus activate NLRP3 more rapidly. It is also interesting that, in long-term models of S. typhimurium infection, the bacteria preferentially resides within alternatively activated or ‘M2’ macrophages, which primarily utilize oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis (Eisele et al., 2013). Thus, the macrophages in which Salmonella survives the longest are those in which host metabolic pathways are minimally perturbed, enabling prolonged infection without invoking an inflammasome response.

These findings additionally shed light on recent work highlighting the connection between metabolic changes and immune system activation (Blatnik et al., 2008; Chawla et al., 2011; Young et al., 1984). For example, metabolic sensing by immune cells has been recently shown to drive NLRP3-dependent IL-1β release and inflammation in diseases ranging from type II diabetes and obesity to Muckle-Wells syndrome (Kuemmerle-Deschner et al., 2011; Strowig et al., 2012), though the specific mechanisms driving macrophage and NLRP3 activation in these diseases have remained unclear. We speculate that, since glucose metabolism is often impaired in these diseases, glycolytic impairment may be the mechanism driving NLRP3-dependent inflammation. Restoring glycolysis or downstream TCA cycle metabolism through supplementation with specific metabolites or activation of glycolytic enzymes could be therapeutically useful for dampening inflammation and associated immunopathology.

In summary, our results suggest that inhibition of glycolysis creates a unique metabolic state that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. They suggest that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, in turn activating NLRP3 to initiate inflammatory responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and S. typhimurium effectively limited glycolysis through distinct mechanisms, each resulting in NLRP3-mediated inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. Glycolytic disruption may be a broadly relevant mechanism of NLRP3 activation triggered in response to metabolic parasitism by microbes. Moreover, this pathway may also provide novel avenues for treating diseases in which NLRP3-driven inflammation results in pathology.

ENOblock (Jung et al., 2013) was a generous gift from Dr. Darren Williams.

## Bacterial strains

Strains used in this study were Salmonella typhimurium NCTC 12023 and ATCC SL1344. Bacteria were grown in LB at 37°C with aeration and supplemented with 0.2% arabinose if needed to induce expression of fluorescent proteins.

## Mice

Mice lacking Pycard, Nlrp3, Nlrc4, and Aim2 have been previously described (Jones et al., 2010; Broz et al., 2010; Kayagaki et al., 2011; Mariathasan et al., 2004). Mice were maintained following guidelines approved by the Stanford University School of Medicine Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.

## Cell culture protocols

BMDM were isolated by culturing mouse bone marrow in DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% FBS, and 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse M-CSF (eBioscience, San Diego CA) for 5 days in petri dishes. After 5 days, the cell monolayer was washed several times with sterile PBS to remove cell debris and then the BMDM harvested using CellStripper (Corning CellGro, Manassas VA). BMDM were then plated for experiments, frozen, or cultured for up to a week. One day prior to treatment, cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 1-2x106 cells/well (or 2x105 cells/well of 24-well dish, or 3x104 cells/well of 96-well dish). C57BL/6 SV40-immortalized macrophages were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and 2 mM L-glutamine and were a generous gift from Petr Broz.

## Replicates and statistical analyses

In this study, biological replicates indicate replicates of the same experiment conducted upon separately seeded cultures on separate days. Technical replicates indicate separate measurements made on cells seeded on the same day and treated simultaneously. The number of biological replicates is indicated in the figure legends and was generally n=3. For plate reader-based assays, experiments were generally conducted in technical triplicate as recommended by assay manufacturers. For microscopy experiments, at least four fields of view were generally analyzed – covering the four quadrants of the cover slip. Within each quadrant, a field was chosen at random using the DAPI channel (to simply find a region that contained cells). Each field of view was counted as a technical replicate because it was a separate measurement of a singly seeded culture. When ascertaining whether differences between samples were statistically significant, an unpaired, two-tailed t test was used. This makes the assumptions that the two samples under analysis were approximately normally distributed and had equal variances. p<0.05 was considered significant. Because measurements were taken within linear range of the detection method (i.e., below saturation and above noise for absorbance-based plate reader assay, within linear range of detector for flow cytometry measurements), etc, technical replicates should be normally distributed around the mean.

## LPS priming and inflammasome activation

BMDM were primed with 100 ng/mL LPS-EK (Invivogen, San Diego CA) or LPS 0111:B4 (Sigma) in DMEM for 3 hr before addition of inflammasome activating agents. GB111-NH2 was added to LPS-primed BMDM at 10 μM (unless otherwise indicated) for inflammasome activation. The canonical NLRP3 activators ATP and nigericin were added to LPS-primed BMDM at 5 mM and 12.5 μM, respectively, typically for 1 hr. Alum (Pierce) was used at a concentration of 100 μg/mL for 5 hr.

## Salmonella typhimurium infections

For stationary phase infections, S. typhimurium grown to stationary phase (typically overnight culture in LB) were centrifuged onto BMDM for 10min at 500g. After 1 hr, medium was switched to DMEM with 100 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate (Sigma) to kill extracellular bacteria. After 1 hr, cells were washed with plain DMEM and then incubated in DMEM with 10 μg/mL gentamicin sulfate for the remainder of the infection. For log phase infections, S. typhimurium in log phase growth (typically a 4 hr subculture of a 1:50 dilution of an overnight culture) were centrifuged onto BMDM for 10min at 500g in antibiotic-free DMEM. Unless otherwise stated, samples were analyzed after 1 hr of log phase infection.

## Probe labeling

Probes were diluted to the desired final concentration (1 μM for AWP28, 250 nM for BMV109) from a 1000x stock solution in DMSO directly in the media of the cell monolayer. Cells were labeled for the final hour of treatment at 37°C prior to sample preparation and analysis. For gel labeling experiments, labeled cell monolayers were washed in PBS and lysed directly with 50 μL sample buffer. For harvested supernatants, following treatment the supernatant was removed and proteins precipitated by adding 4 equivalents of cold acetone. Samples were incubated in acetone overnight at -20°C, then proteins pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm. Acetone was aspirated and protein pellets dried for 30 min at 37°C before addition of sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized on a Typhoon flatbed fluorescent laser scanner (GE Healthcare, United Kingdom).

## Western blots

Following separation of samples by SDS-PAGE and transfer to 0.2 μM nitrocellulose resin (BioRad, Hercules CA), the following antibodies were used. For cell lysates: anti-caspase-1 p10 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology #514), anti-HSP-90 (1:1000, BD Biosciences, San Jose CA), anti-NLRP3 (1:500, R&D Systems, Minneapolis MN), anti-α-tubulin (1:10000, Sigma), anti-GAPDH (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology C-9), anti-α-enolase (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers MA). For cell supernatant: anti-IL-1β (1:200, Cell Signaling Technology). HRP-conjugated α-mouse and α-rabbit secondary antibodies were from GE Healthcare.

## ELISA protocols

BMDMs were seeded in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 3x104 cells/well. Following treatment, the supernatant was removed and IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α release was measured using a Mouse IL-1β, IL-6, or TNF-α READY-SET-GO ELISA kits (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

## LDH release assays

BMDMs were seeds in triplicate in 96-well plates at a density of 3x104 cells/well. Following treatment, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were lysed with 2% Triton-X-100 in D-PBS. The lysate was diluted in culture media to the original volume. LDH release was calculated as supernatant LDH activity/total LDH activity using the CytoTox 96 Assay (Promega, Madison WI).

## Microscopy and image analysis

BMDMs were seeded on poly-L-lysine coated glass coverslips in 24 well plates at a density of 2x105 cells/well. Following treatment and labeling with AWP28 (1 μM for final hour of treatment), the cell monolayer was rinsed 3x with warm D-PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 37°C. The cells were washed with PBS and incubated with anti-ASC (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology N-15) primary antibody in blocking buffer (3% BSA, 0.1% saponin, 0.02% sodium azide in PBS) for 30 min. The cells were washed 3x with PBS and incubated with Alexa 647 or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody (both 1:1000, Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) for 30min. The cells were washed with D-PBS, mounted in Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Labs, Burlingame CA), and imaged on a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope. Snapshots of fields were taken at random (at least 4 fields/condition using a 10x or 20x air objective, typically ~2000 cells/condition). Nuclei were counted using the ITCN plug-in in ImageJ and inflammasome (ASC and/or AWP28 positive) foci were counted using the ‘Analyze Particles’ function in ImageJ after automated thresholding. Replicates indicate cells plated and treated on separate days. For Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, AWP28 labeled cells on coverslips were washed with Annexin V binding buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) and then incubated with 1 μg/mL propidium iodide (ImmunoChemistry, Bloomington MN) and 1:50 Alexa 647 conjugated Annexin V (Invitrogen) in Annexin V-binding buffer on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed with Annexin V-binding buffer and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs) for immediate imaging.

## Mass- spectrometry sample preparation and analysis

## Competition proteomics and sample preparation

C57BL/6 BMDMs were seeded onto 15 cm dishes (2x107 cells/dish). The number of dishes per condition was calculated such that approximately 3 milligrams of protein were yielded per condition. The competition experiment took place as follows: For condition 1, BMDMs were incubated with 100 ng/mL LPS for 3 hr, after which 50 μM az-GB from 100x DMSO stock was added to culture media for 2 hr. For condition 2, BMDMs were incubated with 100 ng/mL LPS for 2 hr. 10 μM GB111-NH2 from 1000x DMSO stock was added to the culture media for 1 hr, after which 50 μM az-GB from 100x DMSO stock was added to culture media for 2 hr. For condition 3, BMDMs were incubated with 100 ng/mL LPS for 2 hr. 50 μM GB-IA from 1000x DMSO stock was added to the culture media for 1 hr, after which 50 μM az-GB from 100x DMSO stock was added to the culture media for 2 hr. For condition 4, BMDMs were incubated with 100 ng/mL LPS for 3 hr, after which vehicle was added for 2 hr. After treatment, all cells were lifted from tissue culture dishes using CellStripper (Corning Cellgro), pelleted at 1000 rpm for 5min, washed once with PBS, and lysed on ice in D-PBS containing 1% NP-40 and 0.1% SDS. Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was removed and protein concentration determined by BCA Assay (Pierce). Protein concentrations were then normalized to 2 mg/mL in PBS with 1% SDS.

## Click chemistry and streptavidin enrichment of probe-labeled proteins

Protein samples (>3 mg/condition) then underwent click chemistry. Biotin azide was added to 10 μM final concentration, fresh TCEP (Sigma) to 1 mM, TBTA (Sigma) to 100 uM, and CuSO4 to 1 mM. The samples were allowed to react at room temperature for 3 hr. Proteins were then precipitated using 5 volumes -20°C acetone. After 2 hr, protein precipitates were pelleted. The pellets were washed 4x with -20°C acetone, air dried, and resuspended in PBS with 1.2% SDS. These solutions were incubated with 100 μL streptavidin-agarose beads (Thermo Scientific) at 4°C for 16 hrs. The solutions were then incubated at room temperature for 2.5 hr. The beads were washed with 0.2% SDS/PBS (5 mL), PBS (3 x 5 mL), and water (3 x 5 mL). The beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1400 x g, 3 min) between washes.

## On-bead trypsin digestion

The washed beads were suspended in 6 M urea/PBS (500 μL) and 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) (from 20X stock in water) and placed in a 65°C heat block for 15 min. Iodoacetamide (20 mM, from 50X stock in water) was then added and the samples were placed in the dark and allowed to react at room temperature for 30 min. Following reduction and alkylation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation (1400 x g, 3 min) and resuspended in 200 μL of 2 M urea/PBS, 1 mM CaCl2 (100X stock in water), and trypsin (2 μg). The digestion was allowed to proceed overnight at 37°C. The peptide digests were separated from the beads using a Micro Bio-Spin column (BioRad). The beads were washed with water (2 x 50 μL) and the washes were combined with the eluted peptides. Formic acid (15 μL) was added to the samples. These tryptic digests were stored at -20°C until mass spectrometry analysis.

## Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis

LC-MS analysis was performed on an LTQ Orbitrap Discovery mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher, Waltham MA) coupled to an Agilent 1200 series HPLC. Digests were pressure loaded onto a 250 μm fused silica desalting column packed with 4 cm of Aqua C18 reverse phase resin (Phenomenex, Torrance CA). The peptides were eluted onto a biphasic column (100 μm fused silica with a 5 μm tip, packed with 10 cm C18 and 3 cm Partisphere strong cation exchange resin (SCX, Whatman, United Kingdom) using a gradient 5–100% Buffer B in Buffer A (Buffer A: 95% water, 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B: 20% water, 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The peptides were eluted from the SCX onto the C18 resin and into the mass spectrometer following the four salt steps outlined in Weerapana et al., 2007. The flow rate through the column was set to ~0.25 μL/min and the spray voltage was set to 2.75 kV. One full MS scan (400–1800 MW) was followed by 8 data dependent scans of the nth most intense ions with dynamic exclusion enabled.

## Mass spectrometry data analysis

The generated tandem MS data was searched using the SEQEST algorithm against the human UNIPROT database. A static modification of +57 on Cys was specified to account for iodoacetamide alkylation. The SEQUEST output files generated from the digests were filtered using DTASelect 2.0 to generate a list of protein hits with a peptide false-discovery rate of <5%.

When comparing results from Conditions 1–4, spectral counts were first normalized based on the spectral counts of the four endogenously biotinylated mammalian proteins, pyruvate carboxylase, 3-methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase, propionyl CoA carboxylase, and acetyl CoA carboxylase (Chandler and Ballard, 1985). Condition 4 determined 'background' levels of reactivity with alkyne-biotin. Candidate proteins were those with >30 spectral counts in condition 1, >80% competition by GB111-NH2 for az-GB binding in condition 2, and less than 50% competition by GB-IA for az-GB binding in condition 3. Pearson correlation between enrichment in different samples and expected enrichment was calculated for confidence in hit proteins.

## Enzyme labeling assays

Recombinant GAPDH (ScienCell, Carlsbad CA), α-enolase (BioVision, Milpitas CA) were diluted into assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2) and incubated with inhibitor or vehicle for 30 min at 37°C. After this, az-GB (50 μM) was added for 2 hr at 37°C. TAMRA-alkyne was then added under previously described Click reaction conditions (Child et al., 2013) to visualize az-GB-labeled protein. Reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized on Typhoon scanner.

## Enzyme activity assays

## GAPDH activity assay

Recombinant GAPDH (0.02 units) was incubated in GAPDH Assay Buffer (ScienCell) for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of inhibitor or vehicle. This mixture was then added to Assay buffer, which contains 6.7 mM phosphoglyceric acid, 3.3 mM L-cysteine, 117 μM β-NADH, 1.13 mM ATP, and 0.05 U 3-phosphoglycerate kinase in 150 μL. A340, representing conversion of β-NADH to NAD+, was measured every minute for 30 min by plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA). Percentage inhibition was calculated as: (treatment △A340/vehicle △A340)x100.

## α-enolase activity assay

Approximately 0.013 units of recombinant α-enolase (MyBioSource.com) were incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2) for 30 min at 37°C in the presence of inhibitor or vehicle. Phosphoenolpyruvate (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mM. A240, representing conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to 2-phosphoglycerate, was measured every minute for 30 min by plate reader. Percentage inhibition was calculated as: (treatment △A240/vehicle △A240)x100.

## Metabolic assays

## NAD+/NADH assay

BMDM were plated in 96-well dishes at 50 k cells/well. The next day, cells were treated with chemical compound or infected with Salmonella typhimurium. Plates were centrifuged at 500g for 5 min at room temperature, after which culture medium was aspirated and 100 μL lysis buffer (Cayman Chemical) added to each well. Plates were nutated at room temperature for 30 min and then centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to wells of a new plate, and 100 μL NAD+/NADH reaction solution (Cayman Chemical) was added to each well. After 1.5 hr, A450 was measured.

## NADH assay

Cells were treated and lysates harvested as for the NAD+/NADH assay. After this, NAD+ was decomposed by heating at 60°C for 30 min. Then, reaction solution was added and after 1.5 hr, A450 was measured.

## Lactate release assay

BMDM were plated in 96-well dishes at 50 k cells/well. The next day, cells were treated with chemical compound or infected with Salmonella typhimurium in phenol red-free DMEM. Plates were centrifuged at 500 g for 5 min at room temperature, after which 50 μL of supernatant/well was transferred to a new 96-well dish. Lactate reaction solution (50 μL; Eton Biosciences, San Diego CA) was added. After 30 min, the reaction was quenched with 50 μL/well of 0.5M acetic acid and A490 was measured.

## ATP assay:

BMDM were plated in opaque-walled 96-well dishes at 50 k cells/well. The next day, the cells were treated with chemical compounds in 100 μL well volume. After 1 hr of treatment at 37°C, the plate was brought to room temperature for 30 min as per manufacturer’s instructions (Promega – CellTiter Glo). ATP reaction mixture was added directly to wells (100 μL/well) and plate was nutated for 2 min to lyse cells. Plate was allowed to stabilize for 10-15 min at room temperature, after which luminescence was read by plate reader (1 s integration time/well).

## Seahorse analyzer assay

For ECAR measurements, BMDM were analyzed using a Seahorse XF96 Analyzer. On the day prior to the assay 8x103 BMDM were plated per well of a 96-well Seahorse Analyzer plate. The next day, cells were washed with and then immersed in 180 mL Assay Medium (RPMI at pH 7.4 with 2 mM L-glutamine and without HEPES or sodium bicarbonate). Cells were incubated in a CO2-free incubator for 1 hr at 37°C. At initiation of assay, the plate was loaded into the Seahorse Analyzer, allowed to equilibrate, and compounds injected in Assay Medium with fresh glucose. ECAR was measured for 2 hr after compound injection. Cells were stained with Hoechst and counted after conclusion of assay. Measured ECAR values were normalized to cell number and averaged across each condition.

## Fluorescent glucose assays

The fluorescent glucose analog 2-NBDG (Cayman Chemical; Abs/Em 465/540 nm) was used to monitor glucose uptake by both infected and uninfected BMDM. BMDM were infected with SL1344 Salmonella typhimurium grown to stationary phase at an MOI of 100:1. After 1 hr, media was changed to DMEM with high gentamicin (100 μg/mL) to kill extracellular bacteria. After 1 hr, BMDM were washed with plain DMEM and then incubated in DMEM with low gentamicin and 10 μM 2-NBDG. For microscopy analysis, cells were fixed and mounted in Vectashield with DAPI after 4 hr of infection. 2-NDBG was imaged using ‘FITC’ absorption/emission settings in ZenBlack software on a Zeiss LSM700 microscope. Quantification of average cytosolic 2-NBDG fluorescence was done using ImageJ software. In the uninfected condition, cytosol was identified as 2-NBDG (+) areas proximal to nuclei. In the infected condition, cytosol was identified as areas proximal to nuclei that were not Salmonella typhimurium (+). 4 fields per sample were quantified and the average and standard deviation of average cytosolic 2-NDBG fluorescence measurements reported. For measurement of 2-NBDG uptake into S. typhimurium, after 7 hr of infection BMDM were lysed in 0.1% Triton-X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 5000 g/10 min/4°C. Supernatant was aspirated and the resulting bacterial pellet resuspended in PBS, transferred to an opaque 96-well plate, and measured in triplicate on a plate reader at Abs/Em 465/540 nm.

## Salmonella replication assays

Salmonella typhimurium (strain 12023) expressing a replication plasmid were grown overnight in LB containing 0.2% arabinose. BMDM were plated in 12-well dishes at 500 k cells/well and infected with Salmonella typhimurium strain NCTC 12,023 at MOI 25:1. At 12, 16, and 24 hr post-infection, BMDM were lysed and bacterial samples analyzed by flow cytometry. Generations of bacteria were calculated as previously described by Helaine et al. For in vitro growth curves, S. typhimurium were grown in MgM-MES minimal media supplemented with 2 mM glucose, 2 mM pyruvate, or vehicle (ddH2O). OD600 was measured at various timepoints after inoculation of culture.

## Mitochondrial ROS measurement

BMDM were plate in 12-well dishes, primed for 3 hr with 100 ng/mL LPS, and then stimulated in the presence or absence of pyruvate. BMDM were labeled for the last 15min of treatment with 2.5 μM MitoSOX Red (Life Technologies), collected, centrifuged for 5min at 2000 rpm at 4°C, then resuspending in ice cold PBS with 0.5% BSA and analyzed by flow cytometry (488 nm excitation, PE channel collection for MitoSOX Red). >25,000 cells were analyzed per condition.

## K+ efflux experiments

LPS-primed BMDM were treated with NLRP3-activating compound in Ringer’s buffer with varying concentrations of K+. Osmolarity was kept constant by varying NaCl concentration accordingly.
